# Rest-API
In this project I built a Rest API which was initially built for authentification.

What was used:
1. Mongoose
2. MongoDB Database
3. Javascript

TO RUN THIS PROJECT YOU MUST RUN: "npm i" to install the neccesary dependencies and run "nodemon server.js/npm start" to start the server 

Please edit the .env file to use the API

If you are interested in working with me email: jvstraphael@gmail.com

The are no licenses attached to the use of my code
